# BHG18 Montreal Collaborative git/GitHub Tutorial

## Terminology
* **ATOM**: A text editor with git/GitHub integration
* **FORK**: Make a personal, editable copy of a public GitHub repository
* **CLONE**: Download the contents of an online git repository onto your local computer
* **BRANCH**: Create a parallel copy/trajectory of a git repository
* **PUSH**: Send local changes of a git repository to the online repository
* **PULL REQUEST**: Request a different fork/branch integrate the changes you've made on a fork/branch of your git repository

## GitHub collaborative workflow
1. Always `fork` a project you want to work on, so you can have your own copy of the original repository. Do this by going to the repository on GitHub and clicking `fork` in the top-right corner.
2. Making sure you have git installed on your computer, open a terminal and type: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reponame`. A new directory will be created titled `yourreponame`.
3. Open [Atom](https://atom.io/), click **File --> Add a project folder**, and select the folder `yourreponame`.
